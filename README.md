# Personalized Migraine Risk Assessment and Attack Prediction
# Introduction
This repository hosts a Python-based project aimed at leveraging multi-modal data for personalized migraine risk assessment and attack prediction. It encompasses data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of advanced machine learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
